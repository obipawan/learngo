# Learn Go

The contents of this repository are notes and examples I collected on the internet while learning Go. 

> The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

There are plenty of resources that are available on the internet to learn Go incuding the [GoLang](https://golang.org/doc/)'s official website. However, I intend to use this repository to record notes and learn the language at my own pace and something I can look back to for reference.
